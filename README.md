Project Title - Optimizing Emergency Response Routes: A Pathfinding Approach For The Bureau Of Fire President 

Description - This study focuses on developing a system that enhances the efficiency of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) in responding to emergencies by providing optimized routes for fire trucks and emergency personnel. The project applies pathfinding algorithms to determine the fastest and most accessible routes, taking into consideration factors such as traffic conditions, road accessibility, and distance. By minimizing response time, the system aims to improve public safety, reduce potential damages, and support firefighters in carrying out their duties effectively. The approach not only strengthens the operational capacity of the BFP but also introduces the integration of technology-driven solutions in emergency management.
